## Identified Personas

### The Parallel Agent Orchestrator

**Role**: Developer/tech lead using multiple AI coding agents simultaneously

**Environment**:
- Remote development via SSH/tmux
- 10+ concurrent Claude Code (or similar) sessions
- Voice dictation for input (Wispr Flow)
- Linear for task management

**Goals**:
- Maximize productive output per unit of human attention
- Understand where time is actually going
- Ensure time aligns with stated priorities
- Identify which work patterns enable parallelization

**Frustrations**:
- Desktop trackers are blind to SSH internals
- Interleaved work makes manual tracking impossible
- Retroactive categorization is tedious and lossy
- Can't see human vs agent time breakdown
- No priority alignment visibility

**Current Tools**:
- Toggl (desktop activity, calendar integration)
- Custom fill-toggl script (retroactive Claude session analysis)
- Linear (task management)

**Quote**: "If you're able to get much more agent time out of each unit of human time, that's a well-managed project."

**Key Insight**: This user doesn't need a time tracker - they need a priority alignment system that happens to track time as one signal among many.

### Future Personas (to be validated)

**The Solo Contractor**: Bills hourly, needs accurate time for invoicing. Less concerned with priority alignment, more with accuracy and auditability.

**The Team Lead**: Wants visibility into team's parallel agent usage. Interested in patterns across multiple developers, capacity planning.

**The Productivity Optimizer**: Personal use, not billing. Wants insights into focus patterns, context-switching costs, optimal work rhythms.
