# Code Planning Instructions

You're preparing to implement a code task.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the task** in `specs/plan.md`

2. **Find the spec**: Locate the relevant spec in `specs/`. If missing or incomplete, flag it—the spec must be written first.

3. **Understand the approach**:
   - Read the spec thoroughly
   - Identify acceptance criteria
   - Note performance requirements

4. **Investigate codebase**:
   - Find similar patterns in existing code
   - Identify files that will need changes
   - Check for existing tests to extend

5. **Write the plan**: Save to `specs/plan.current.md`:
   - Files to create/modify
   - Test cases needed
   - Implementation approach
   - Any resolved questions

6. **Review**: Do a focused self-review of your plan. Are there simpler approaches?

7. **Hand off**: Plan is ready for the implementing phase.

## Before You Hand Off

Verify `specs/plan.current.md` includes:
- [ ] Spec exists and is complete
- [ ] Files to change identified
- [ ] Test cases outlined
- [ ] No open questions remain
