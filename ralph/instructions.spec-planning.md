# Spec Planning Instructions

You're researching a topic before writing a spec.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the spec task** in `specs/plan.md`

2. **Research first**: Search for prior art before designing anything:
   - How do similar tools solve this? (ActivityWatch, Toggl, Clockify, WakaTime)
   - What are established best practices?
   - What pitfalls have others documented?
   - Use `web.run` to find real-world approaches

3. **Investigate codebase**: Read existing specs and code. Understand what's already decided.

4. **Compile findings**: Document what you learned:
   - What competitors do and why
   - Best practices from documentation/blogs
   - Trade-offs and pitfalls to avoid
   - Recommended approach with rationale

5. **Write the plan**: Save to `specs/plan.current.md`:
   - Research summary
   - Recommended approach
   - Open questions resolved
   - Outline of what the spec will cover

6. **Review**: Do a focused self-review of the research and recommended approach.

7. **Hand off**: Plan is ready for the implementing phase.

## Research is Non-Negotiable

Don't design in a vacuum. Learn from what others have built:
- Search for "[topic] best practices"
- Look at how competitors handle the same problem
- Find blog posts about what worked and what didn't
